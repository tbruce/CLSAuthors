How it works.

This code supports the creation of RDF triples containing metadata about legal scholars and their publications. Basic
information about the scholars is entered in a GoogleDocs spreadsheet; the application uses this data to access and
leverage other information, primarily from SSRN.  The results are output as triples conforming to a related OWL
ontology.

Right now, it's a blunt instrument that regenerates everything every time.  This may result in annoying over-harvesting
from SSRN.


General behavior

+ Application reads author metadata from the Google spreadsheet.
+ For each author
    + Triples that can be generated solely from the author metadata are created.
    + The SSRN author page is scraped. No metadata is taken directly from it, as it doesn't have much that we can
    scrape/use.  A list of URLs for SSRN abstracts is generated.
    + The list of abstracts is processed.  For each abstract:
        + Metadata is extracted and turned into triples.
        + The abstract is sent to Citationer for citation extraction.
        + The paper's PDF is retrieved.
        + The paper PDF is sent to LII's Citationer extraction program and all citations returned, and stored as
        triples.

All triples are output to a single file.  For updating and data-management purposes, the file can be split into
several files (author info, paper info, citation info) by specifying the --splitfile command-line switch

Operation

All triples go to STDOUT by default.

+  Command-line switches
    + --nossrn  inhibits harvesting of papers from SSRN
    + --splitfile reprocesses the output file into separate chunks for management purposes.
