Fixing
-- truncate subsection references from citationer results
-- look at named legislation matching in DBPedia, find a better way



Testing
-- find example paper with scotus citations


Someday

 -- add Federal agency name extraction to PDFs
 -- can leverage "people who downloaded this also downloaded" feature of paper abstracts


 Citationer notes

 Citationer currently returns three types of response

 -- a "standard" response consisting of a key and an array of hashes containing citation information
 -- an "error" response consisting of PHP error information (looks like this:
    "{"SSRN-id2041517.pdf.part":{"error":{"type":"PHP_UPLOAD_ERR","code":3,"emsg":"The uploaded file was only partially uploaded"}}}")
 -- a "blank" response consisting of a key and an empty array.

 I suspect the "blank" response happens when there's an uncaught (and probably unsuspected) error in citationer. It
 would be good to figure out what causes this and send an error-type response with diagnostic information instead of
 the blank response.
